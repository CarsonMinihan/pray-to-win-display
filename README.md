# pray-to-win-frontend

This page is mostly static and has limited functionality so it can be viewed without a full backend

If you want to view or run this code, then you need to go into your terminal go to the file and run "npm install" this will install all required dependencies 

Then run "json-server --id _id db.json" this will start the 'fake' backend

Then in a seperate terminal run "ng serve --o" this will open the page
